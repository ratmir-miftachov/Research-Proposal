# Research-Proposal
This is a first draft of my Research Proposal for potential PhD study in the area of statistics and econometrics. 
The proposal is concerned with the novel feature weighted elastic net regularization by Tay, Aghaeepour, Hastie and Tibshirani (2020). We extend the estimation technique to the VAR model and propose three different grouping schemes in a high-dimensional variable case. These schemes allow the researcher to inject her prior beliefs on the variable structure in the shrinkage procedure. The idea of so called "co-data" is incorporated into the model.
